    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is a simple recipe I have been following since I started my weight loss journey. It is a quick and easy recipe to make your own healthy wrap that can make dieting a lot easier.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>100 gm (1 Cup) of rolled oats.</li>
        <li>200 gm of warm water</li>
        <li>Half tsp of Flax Seeds</li>
        <li>half tsp of Salt</li>
        <li>Spices to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Grind the oats till you reach fine-powder texture</li>
        <li>In a new bowl, add the oats and pour the water gently</li>
        <li>Whisk them together well</li>
        <li>Add the Flax Seeds and Spices (optional)</li>
        <li>After the mixture is done. Leave it to rest for 10 minutes until it thickens</li>
        <li>Heat up a non stick frying pan</li>
        <li>After you make sure that the pan is well heated, bring the heat down to medium</li>
        <li>Pour a portion of the mix into the pan and make sure it is spread evenly</li>
        <li>Wait a few minutes until the bottom of the wrap is almost done</li>
        <li>Flip the wrap and let it cook for a few more minutes.</li>
        <li>Make sure not to raise the heat, in order to avoid a burnt outside and undercooked inside</li>
        <li>Take out the wrap and put it on a kitchen towel</li>
        <li>Cover it with another towel and repeat the steps till the mix is out</li>
    </ol>
